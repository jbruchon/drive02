Bank switching, relocatable ZP, caching, need to be handled here
  malloc
  mfree
  memcpy
  memset

  createpid
  getcpid

Need directory support (i.e. 1581)
  mount/umount
  open/close/read/write
  unlink

block:
1541/1571/1581, IDE64, REU, etc. support needed

General stuff
-------------
Need ability to handle sleeping/blocked tasks in scheduler and process mgmt
Processes need to be able to cleanly break
Drivers register IRQ/NMI hooks on driver load/initialization
Scheduler calls mm routines when switching tasks to ensure RAM/stack/ZP
placement and banking is correctly configured to run the process
Memory mgmt would benefit from memory prioritization, so that devices such 
as VIC-II hi-res mode which needs to be in $2000-$3FFF are less likely to 
have the needed memory area occupied, preventing mode switching.
VIC-II driver should support changing VIC-II banks and text area locations 
as needed.
